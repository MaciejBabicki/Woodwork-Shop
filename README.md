Online Shop with wood regional garden items
The idea is to sell windmills which I made in past.
Funtionality for admin is to add the products to the shop with the price and photo.

Functionality for the client is to choose products and put it to the cart. When there are products of many types in cart client can increase or decrease their amount.
After choosing the products to buy there is necessary to make an order. To make an order client must to entry the personal data.
